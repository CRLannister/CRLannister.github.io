In a coat of gold or a coat of red,
a lion still has claws,
And mine are long and sharp, my Lord,
as long and sharp as yours.2

And so he spoke, and so he spoke,
that lord of Castamere,
But now the rains weep o'er his hall,
with no one there to hear.

Yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall,
and not a soul to hear.
And who are you, the proud lord said,
that I must bow so low?1

Only a cat of a different coat,
that's all the truth I know.
In a coat of gold or a coat of red,
a lion still has claws,

And mine are long and sharp, my lord,
as long and sharp as yours.
And so he spoke, and so he spoke,
that lord of Castamere,

But now the rains weep o'er his hall,
with no one there to hear.
Yes, now the rains weep o'er his hall,
and not a soul to hear.

				 <h3>Winter howls and roars and the cub lay slayed.</h3>
					<p>Winter is coming growls
The House Stark.
Wights creep towards the Wall
In the dark.

Stags fight, krakens rise and
Lions roar
Fight for an iron chair,
Forged by war.

Dragons dance and dream of
Lands once roamed,
Vict’ry in the Game of Thrones.

Free your third eye,
Will you make it home?
You win or die
When you play the Game of Thrones.

				 <h3>You will know you are crazy if you read all the way to the end.</h3>
					<p>Yeah, uh huh, House Baratheon
Black and yellow Yeah, uh huh, House Baratheon
Black and yellow Yeah, uh huh, House Baratheon
King's Landing, Dragonstone, Storm's End
Yeah, uh huh, Ours is the fury
Takin' Westeros, Y'all better hurry
Flyin the banners when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow Bend the knee and I'll show you who da real king
Black and yellow Black stag, yellow field,
Take my rightful throne with this flaming steel
Post-rebellion stuck out here on Dragonstone
My own wife has me in the friend zone
Onion Knight, That's my man Davos
He's My right hand - his hand? Whoops Adios
And Robert's wife slept with her twin brother
Her son Joffrey, what a disrespectful bitch just like his mother
Renly's heading north, claimed a girl as his new lover
But the knight of flowers plays with him under the covers
Melisandre gave me a new start
Azor Ahai, Flaming heart

Tired of takin' hand-me-downs from my older kin
Gonna steal the king's crown, get out of storm's end
The ladies like me, with my chest shaved
Step to me Brienne will put you to the test knave
So yeah you best cave, If not to her then Loras
Call him the knight of flowers then you can call me the florist
Representin' Stormlands to The Reach
You and your Red God can go and eat a peach

I ruled from the Iron Throne
My warhammer took that royal crown, straight crushed Rhaegar's dome
And my Queen was unapproachable
Now I'm dead and they took Ned's head
I wanna sleep with some whores, drink wine, hunt boars, eat meat, the Targaryens done for, wage war, Baratheon line, true stags to our core, no lions or dragons, better refill my flagon, pour!

Yeah, uh huh, House Baratheon
