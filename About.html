1.“Family isn’t about whose blood you have. It’s  about who you care about.”

2.Love is friendship, set on fire.” 

3.“Love is the irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired.”

4.The person who reads too much and uses his brain too little will fall into lazy habits of thinking.

5.Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.

6.The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources. 

7.The difference between genius and stupidity is; genius has its limits.

8.A ship is always safe at the shore - but that is NOT what it is built for.

9.It would be possible to describe everything scientifically, but it would make no   sense; it would be without meaning, as if you described a Beethoven symphony as   a variation of wave pressure.

10.Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man&#39;s character, give him power.

11.If you think your teacher is tough, wait till you get a boss.

12.If you want to be seen, stand up.  If you want to be heard, speak up.  If you want to be appreciated, shut up.

13.The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.

14.Books are like mirrors: if a fool looks in, you cannot expect a genius to look out.

15.An economist is an expert who will know tomorrow why the things he predicted yesterday   didn&#39;t happen today.

16.By three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is noblest; Second, by   imitation, which is easiest; and third by experience, which is the bitterest.

17.The man who asks a question is a fool for a minute, the man who does not ask is a   fool for life.

18. A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life.

19.Never close your lips to those whom you have already opened your heart.

20.I do not have much patience with a thing of beauty that must be explained to be  understood. If it does need additional interpretation by someone other than the  creator, then I question whether it has fulfilled its purpose.

21.Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn&#39;t do   than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor.  Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.

22.The darker the night, the brighter the stars,  The deeper the grief, the closer is God.
			</p>
		<p>

23.Go to Heaven for the climate, Hell for the company

24.If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a  leader

25.  History repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce.

26.The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways: the point, however, is   to change it

27.What a joy it is to do a good deed! And this joy is strongest if no one knows that you   have done it.

28.I object to violence because when it appears to do good,   the good is only temporary; the evil it does is permanent.

29.A coward is incapable of exhibiting love; it is the prerogative of the brave.

30.An ounce of practice is worth more than tons of preaching

31.I suppose leadership at one time meant muscles; but today it means getting   along with people.

32.If you judge people, you have no time to love them.

33.I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the waters to create   many ripples.

			<p>जित्छौं भन्ने बिश्वास कम पनि छैन ।
जित्नै पर्ने तेस्तो कुनै अहम् पनि छैन ।
हामी आफैले सोचेजस्तो असल न हुन सक्छौं,
तर दुनियाँले सोच्ने जस्तो खत्तम पनि छैन ॥
